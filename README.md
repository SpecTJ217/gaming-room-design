# CS 230 Project Portfolio Entry

### Summary of The Gaming Room Client

The Gaming Room was the client. They wanted a web-based version of their game "Draw It or Lose It." The requirements included supporting multiple platforms, handling multiple players and teams, and ensuring unique entity names across the system.

### What I Did Well

I did well in breaking down the requirements into clear design sections. The documentation shows my ability to evaluate operating platforms and outline the design constraints, which made the design clear and professional.

### What Helped in Coding

Working through the design document first made the coding process easier. Having the architecture, requirements, and constraints planned out gave me a roadmap for building the classes and methods in code.

### What I Would Revise

If I were to revise something, I would improve the UML diagram section. I would make it cleaner and more detailed to better represent the relationships between the classes.

### Interpreting User Needs

I focused on what the client required, such as uniqueness of names and support for multiple platforms. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the software actually solves the clientâ€™s problem and creates a better user experience.

### My Approach to Designing Software

My approach was to break the problem down step by step, starting with requirements, then design, then constraints, then the architecture view. In the future, I will continue using structured planning and UML diagrams before coding to make sure I have a complete picture of the system.
